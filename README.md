# Traffic Signal Control with Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Welcome to the **Traffic Signal Control with MPC** project! This repository contains a model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize traffic signal timing for improved traffic flow and reduced congestion. The project includes simulations, analyses, and documentation that outline the approach, methodology, and results.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply model predictive control to manage and optimize traffic signal operations. Using predictive models, the controller can anticipate traffic patterns and adjust signals dynamically, thereby reducing wait times, improving flow, and adapting to fluctuating demand.

The project includes:
- Development and testing of different traffic models.
- Simulations to demonstrate MPC's impact on traffic signal performance.
- Jupyter notebooks to allow interactive experimentation.
- Data and visualization resources for in-depth analysis.

## Repository Structure
Here’s a breakdown of the main folders and their contents:

- **data**: Contains datasets used for simulations and testing.
- **figures**: Stores visual outputs, including plots and diagrams, generated during simulations.
- **models**: Holds definitions of different traffic systems to be controlled.
- **notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with interactive simulations and experiments.
- **report**: Includes documentation and reports summarizing the project’s goals, methodology, and findings.
- **src**: Contains core scripts and functions for MPC implementations.
- **tests**: Scripts to validate and test various components of the project.
- **utils**: Utility functions and classes used across different parts of the project.
