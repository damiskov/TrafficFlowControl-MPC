# Source Code

The `src` folder contains core scripts and functions that implement the model predictive control logic.

These scripts are used throughout the project and are often called within the `notebooks` to perform simulations, calculate results, and manage system control processes. Functions here are modular and can be reused across various notebooks and tests.
